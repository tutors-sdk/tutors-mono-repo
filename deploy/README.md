# Deploying Tutors as containers

One `Dockerfile` at the repo root builds any of the four SvelteKit apps
(`reader`, `catalogue`, `live`, `time`) into a self-contained Node.js image.
Runtime configuration is read from the environment, so the same image is
promoted through every environment and no secret is baked into a layer.

## Build

```bash
docker build --build-arg APP_NAME=reader -t tutors/reader .
docker build --build-arg APP_NAME=catalogue -t tutors/catalogue .
docker build --build-arg APP_NAME=live -t tutors/live .
docker build --build-arg APP_NAME=time -t tutors/time .
```

Optional build args: `NODE_VERSION` (default `22`), `GIT_SHA` and `BUILD_DATE`
for the OCI labels. The build needs BuildKit (default in Docker 23+).

## Published images

The `Container Image Build` workflow (`.github/workflows/image-build.yml`)
builds all four apps from this Dockerfile and publishes them to
`quay.io/tutors-sdk/tutors-<app>`. Every image is scanned with Trivy before
the job passes; CRITICAL and HIGH findings with an available fix fail it.

| Event | Tags pushed |
| --- | --- |
| Pull request (touching the build context) | none, build and scan only |
| Push to `main` | `sha-<short>`, `latest` |
| Push to an `rc/**` branch | `rc-<branch>`, `sha-<short>` |
| Tag `vX.Y.Z` | `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, `sha-<short>` |

Pushing needs two repository secrets holding a Quay.io robot account:
`QUAY_USERNAME` and `QUAY_PASSWORD`. Without them PR builds still run; only
the push steps on `main`, `rc/**` and tags need the credentials.

## Staging stack

`deploy/staging/compose.yaml` runs the four published images on one host,
with the same read-only, capability-dropped posture as the local stack. It
builds nothing, so `IMAGE_TAG` selects exactly what to run:

```bash
cd deploy/staging
cp .env.example .env               # Supabase, OAuth, Moodle, origins
IMAGE_TAG=rc-16.2.0 docker compose up -d
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d   # roll forward
```

Set each `*_ORIGIN` to the URL users reach the app on; adapter-node uses it
for absolute URLs and CSRF checks.

## Run locally

A step-by-step walkthrough, including troubleshooting, is in
[`docs/LOCAL-CONTAINERS.md`](../docs/LOCAL-CONTAINERS.md).

```bash
docker compose up --build          # all four apps on ports 3000-3003
docker compose up --build reader   # one app
```

Compose reads an optional `.env` in the repo root (see `.env.example`).
Without one the apps start in anonymous mode (`PUBLIC_ANON_MODE=TRUE`), which
needs no Supabase project. If a host port is taken, override it, for example
`READER_PORT=3010 docker compose up reader`.

## Image contract

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Port | `3000` (`PORT` env) |
| User | UID `1001`, GID `0` (OpenShift arbitrary-UID compatible) |
| Filesystem | read-only safe; nothing is written at runtime |
| Liveness | `GET /healthz/live` returns `{"status":"ok"}` with no dependencies |
| Readiness | `GET /healthz` also reports Supabase reachability |
| Metrics | `GET /metrics` in Prometheus text format (request histogram/counter, in-flight gauge, Node process metrics) |
| Entrypoint | `node build/index.js` (SvelteKit adapter-node) |

Environment variables the server reads at startup:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ORIGIN` | Public URL of the app, required for correct absolute URLs and CSRF checks |
| `PROTOCOL_HEADER`, `HOST_HEADER`, `ADDRESS_HEADER`, `XFF_DEPTH` | Trust proxy headers when behind a Route or Ingress |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase project; omit both to run without it |
| `PUBLIC_ANON_MODE` | `TRUE` disables authentication and analytics |
| `PRIVATE_AUTH_GITHUB_ID`, `PRIVATE_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`, `PRIVATE_AUTH_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth for the reader app |
| `MOODLE_WS_URL`, `MOODLE_WS_TOKEN`, `MOODLE_WS_REST_FORMAT`, `SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | Moodle sync for the time app |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error` |
| `METRICS_TOKEN` | When set, `GET /metrics` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; unset leaves it open |

## Metrics

Every app serves `GET /metrics` on its normal port: `http_request_duration_seconds`,
`http_requests_total` and `http_requests_in_flight`, labelled by method, matched
route and status, plus the default Node.js process metrics. `/metrics` and the
`/healthz` probes are not counted. The route label is the SvelteKit route id,
so unmatched requests share one `unmatched` series.

Because the endpoint sits behind the public Route, set `METRICS_TOKEN` in
production and give the scraper the same value (Prometheus `authorization`,
ServiceMonitor `endpoints[].authorization`).

`observability/compose.yaml` starts Prometheus and Grafana, provisioned with
the data source, alert rules (error rate, p99 latency, target down) and a
contact point template. It scrapes the apps through their host ports, so it
runs alongside either the local stack or the staging stack:

```bash
cd observability && docker compose up -d   # Prometheus :9090, Grafana :3004
```

On a cluster with the Prometheus Operator (OpenShift user-workload
monitoring), add the ServiceMonitor component to an overlay:

```yaml
components:
  - ../../components/servicemonitor
```

The pod template also carries `prometheus.io/scrape` annotations for
annotation-driven scrapers.

## Kubernetes / OpenShift

`deploy/k8s/base` holds a shared Deployment, Service, ConfigMap and
PodDisruptionBudget. Each overlay under `deploy/k8s/overlays/<app>` sets the
image, the name prefix, labels and the public `ORIGIN`.

```bash
kubectl kustomize deploy/k8s/overlays/reader   # render
oc apply -k deploy/k8s/overlays/reader          # deploy
```

Each overlay points at `quay.io/tutors-sdk/tutors-<app>`, which the image
build workflow publishes. Image tags are pinned to the release version in the
root `package.json` (never `latest`); the release checklist bumps them
together, and the workflow publishes that tag from the `v<version>` git tag.
To try an unreleased build, set `newTag` to `sha-<short>` locally. Fill in the
ConfigMap values before applying. The reader overlay expects a
`reader-tutors-app-oauth` Secret; copy `overlays/reader/secrets.yaml.example`
to `secrets.yaml` (git-ignored) and apply it separately. Every app also reads
an optional `<app>-tutors-app-secrets` Secret for `METRICS_TOKEN`
(`base/secrets.yaml.example`); the time app's example adds `MOODLE_WS_TOKEN`.

`pnpm check:k8s` renders every overlay and checks it against the policies in
`scripts/checks/conformance.ts`: pinned images, requests and limits, probes,
and a security context `restricted-v2` admits. CI also validates the rendered
output with kubeconform. Every variable the apps read must appear both in
`.env.example` and in these manifests, or the conformance tests fail.

The pod spec runs as non-root with a read-only root filesystem, all
capabilities dropped and the default seccomp profile, which satisfies the
OpenShift `restricted-v2` SCC without any extra grants.
